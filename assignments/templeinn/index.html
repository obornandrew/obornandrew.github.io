                    <p>The San Diego California Temple is the 47th constructed and 45th operating temple of
                         The
                         Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Located near the La Jolla community of San Diego,
                         it
                         was
                         built with two main spires, but unique to this temple are four smaller spires at the base of
                         each
                         main
                         spire. The East spire is topped with the familiar Angel Moroni statue which adorns most LDS
                         temples.
                    </p>
                    <p>The San Diego Temple was announced on April 7, 1984, and dedicated on April 25, 1993
                         by
                         Gordon B. Hinckley. The temple was built on a 7.2-acre (2.9 ha) plot, has 4 ordinance rooms and
                         8
                         sealing
                         rooms, and has a total floor area of 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).</p>
                    <p>Although there is no visitors' center, the church maintains the Mormon Battalion
                         Historic
                         Site in Old Town, San Diego.</p>
